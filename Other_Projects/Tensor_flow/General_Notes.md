Getting ready to try tensorflow.

Started a new environment in anaconda called tensorflow.

I also started a new jupyter notebook.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation

Going to try to work through this process.

Going to notes called tensorflow_segmentation.md

now we are going to install the tenserflow package in anaconda.

I am up to Anaconda 2.1.4 now.

then I did tensorflow_datasets or something, and it worked for the first couple of lines.

pertinent information:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42451

trying
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git

it ran without the ! out front.

now we trying
!pip install -q git+http://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git

without the ! it runs.

But then I went out to the github page, cloned it down, and then pulled tensorflow_exapmles up a level. Then it worked.
