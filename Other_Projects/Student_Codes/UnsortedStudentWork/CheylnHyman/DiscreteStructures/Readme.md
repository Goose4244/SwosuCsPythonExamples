### Chapter 1: 
    Write a program: Given two bit strings of length n, find the bitwise AND,bitwise OR, and bitwise XOR of these strings.
### Chapter 2:
    Write a program: Write a program that gives the first five terms of a sequence
    and asks the user to guess the sixth. The program should be able to choose between four sequences
### Chapter 3:
    Write a program: Implement the Cashier's algorithm.
### Chapter 4:
    Write a program: Write a program to count the number of primes less than some number.
    Make a log plot of the number of primes less than ten, one hundred, a thousand, ten thousand,
    a hundred thousand and a million. Predict the number of primes les than 10 million
### Chapter 5:
    Write a program: Write a program that solves a problem iteratively, and then solve that same problem 
    with recursion. Measure the number of steps taken to solve the problem each way. Please discuss the differences.
### Chapter 6:
    Write a program: Write a program to answer this question. Look at Example 4 in chapter 6.5. 
    Suppose a cookie shop has four different kinds of cookies. How many different ways can six cookies be chosen? 
    Assume the type of cookie and not the individual cookies or the order in which they are chosen matters.
### PrimceCounter: 
    This is a Python program that uses multiprocessing to find the number of prime numbers within a specified range,
    divided into chunks and assigned to separate processes. The average time taken to find the primes is calculated over 
    a specified number of tests and the results include the number of primes found, number of CPU cores, number of processes, 
    average time, and total elapsed time.
