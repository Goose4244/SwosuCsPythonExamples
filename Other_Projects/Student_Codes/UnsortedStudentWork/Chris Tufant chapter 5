 Iterative Solution:
def factorial_iterative(n):
    result = 1
    steps = 0  # Counter for steps
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
        steps += 1
    
    return result, steps

n = 5
result, steps = factorial_iterative(n)
print(f"Factorial of {n} is {result}")
print(f"Steps taken (iterative): {steps}")

Recursive Solution:
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1, 1
    else:
        result, steps = factorial_recursive(n - 1)
        result *= n
        steps += 1
        return result, steps

n = 5
result, steps = factorial_recursive(n)
print(f"Factorial of {n} is {result}")
print(f"Steps taken (recursive): {steps}")

Factorial of 5 is 120
Steps taken (iterative): 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
Steps taken (recursive): 5
