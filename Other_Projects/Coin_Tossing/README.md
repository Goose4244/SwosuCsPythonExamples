# Coin Toss README file
This file explains some of the thoughts on what we are trying to do.

The goal of this project is to show off different tools that are handy for students in
Computer Science 1
Computer Science 2
Discrete Structures

and possibly other classes.

How many coins should you flip at once to have half a chance to get 2 of the same kind in a row?

How many coins should you flip at once to have a 60% chance to get 2 of the same kind in a row?

How many coins should you flip at once to have an X% chance to get 2 of the same kind in a row, where X is 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%

How many coins should you flip at once to have an X% chance to get n of the same kind in a row, where X is 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%,
and n is 2, 3, ... , 10?
