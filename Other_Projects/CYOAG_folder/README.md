# Building a Choose Your Own Adventure Guide
Welcome to a set of notes on how to make a choose your own adventure game. The goal is to have some fun with Python programming. The idea behind this is that you have several fun tools from working in programming classes, and now you can taste the fruits of your labor. Making your own story allows you to put your own stamp on an idea. Hopefully you enjoy your idea enough that you keep working on it. As you keep working on it, you will also keep making the game better. Improvements in the game will likely call on your programming and problem solving skills. Thank you for continuing to invest in your own personal development.

# Notes
Every level of learning can accommodate a different level of production. Even the humble print statement can be used to tell a joke.
>```python
print('I am not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.')
print('Michael Scott (Steve Carrell), The Office')
>```

The general idea is that stories are going to be able to grow to different sizes given your skill set. The goal is to provide some fun examples to get you started based on what is commonly covered in Chapters of common books. Sometimes it is fun and instructional to limit yourself to only the tools in a certain chapter to help reinforce what you can really do with that set of tools.

This is the process for some:
* Okay, lets begin.
* I see what they ask me to do
* I can do what they ask me to do
* I see how I can make this better
* Can I do this with these tools?
* I can't do this with these tools
* I need to find something else
* I found something else I can try
* I was able to make this work

Hopefully this process is rewarding for you. This is also a lesson in design. Sometimes you need to scale your design back. That is a hard lesson to learn.

## Notes on project design
The goal of this project is to help you improve your skills. Design is one of those skills. These projects take time, but they also bring joy to many. Sometimes teams can spend more than a week designing their project. The end result is a great plan, but not much fun to play as a user.

## Chapter 1 list of tools

In chapter 1, there are some fun things to do. Here are a list of skills you can consider:
* Print statements where you keep things on the same line
```python
# Including end=' ' keeps output on same line
print('Hello there.', end=' ')
```
* Printing a variable
```python
wage = 20
print('Wage is', end=' ')
print(wage)  # print variable's value
```
* printing things over multiple lines:
```python
print('1\n2\n3')
```
* Getting input from the users:
```python
print('Enter name of best friend:', end=' ')
best_friend = input()
print('My best friend is', best_friend)
```

## Chapter 1 ideas for fun
One way to start to have fun here is with some simple MadLibs. In this game, you ask the user to give you some words. Then you use the words in a story. This can lead to some funny results.

Here is a tutorial that can help you get started: https://kidscodecs.com/python-mad-libs/

## Chapter 2 list of tools
There should be some stuff here.

# CYOAG tutorial
I did a search for python text based adventure game.
Here is the link I cam up with:

We will see how this goes.
part of the game story is taken from the book Learn Python The Hard Way written by Zed Shaw.
