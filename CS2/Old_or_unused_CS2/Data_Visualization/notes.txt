Sure! Here's a random data visualization question:

"You have a dataset showing daily coffee sales at five coffee shops over a year. What type of chart would best show the trend over time, and how would you make it easy to compare the performance of all five shops?"

Got it â€” hereâ€™s a quick dataset you can use:

This is just five days to keep it simple, but you can easily stretch it to a whole month or year if you want.

Want me to also throw in a "hard mode" version with more messy or missing data? ðŸŽ¯
